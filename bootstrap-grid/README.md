# Nested Grid Challenge

In this activity, you will use your knowledge of Bootstrap components, CSS, and nested grids to recreate a layout.

## Instructions

- Open the provided layout image and plan the nested grid system that is required to recreate the page.

- The page must meet the following conditions:

  - The content in the jumbotron must line up with the content below.

  - The length of the navigation menu on the left of the page must not interfere with the layout to the right. For example, a very long list must not cause any gaps in between the card components to the right.

  - The only the bootstrap grid should be controlling layout. No floats!

## Hints

- Look on the Bootstrap website for the components used.

- Custom CSS will be required to adjust spacing between the cards.

- Consider using a class to align the hyperlinks in the "Images of the Week" section.

- Adjust the width and height of the images so that they appear to be square but do not overflow the card or column. Use your Google-Fu skills to explore the best way to do this.

## Bonus

- Style the page to the match the aesthetic of the your customized progress bar.
