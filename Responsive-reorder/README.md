# Responsive Order

In this activity, you will be altering code to change the layout of a website while also changing the order of the elements for different screen sizes.

## Instructions

- Find a partner.

- Using the code given in `responsiveOrdering.html`, add classes to complete the following:

  - At `xs` and `sm` screen sizes:

    - The "Articles of Lesser Importance", "Main Headlines", and "Images of the Week" sections should span the screen width. In other words, they should stack one on top of the other.

    - The "Images of the Week" should be a 2x2 grid.

    - The "Main Headlines" section should be at the top, followed by "Articles of Lesser Importance", then "Images of the Week".

  - At `md` screen sizes:

    - The "Articles of Lesser Importance" and "Main Headlines" sections should appear to be in the same row with the "Images of the Week at the bottom."

    - The "Images of the Week" section should be a 1x4 grid.

  - At `lg` and `xl` sizes the layout should be the same as the starter code.

## Hints

  - See the layout images for visuals: `XgXlLayout.png`, `MdLayout.png`, `XsSmLayout.png`.

  - Work on the layout of the three main sections first, then the "Images of the Week", then the ordering.
